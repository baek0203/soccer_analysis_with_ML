# Soccer Data Analysis with Machine Learning

This project explores how machine learning and visualization techniques can be used
to extract insights from soccer match data.

I started it from a simple curiosity:
**what kind of data problems do I genuinely enjoy working on?**



## 🎯 Project Goal

The goal of this project is to:

- Analyze soccer-related datasets using Python & Jupyter
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualization
- Apply basic machine learning models
- Understand how quantitative features relate to match outcomes or performance



## 📊 Dataset & Analysis Scope

The notebook includes:

- Loading and cleaning soccer match / player data
- Feature exploration using statistical summaries
- Visualization of key variables (distributions, correlations, trends)
- Identification of meaningful patterns in the data



## 🛠️ Implementation

All analysis is contained in the Jupyter Notebook:

### `ML_analysis_with_visualation.ipynb`

Inside the notebook, I:

1. **Preprocessed the data**
   - Handled missing values
   - Selected relevant numerical features
   - Converted raw data into analysis-ready form

2. **Explored the data visually**
   - Used plots to understand distributions and relationships
   - Compared features that may affect performance or outcomes

3. **Applied machine learning models**
   - Trained simple ML models for prediction or classification
   - Evaluated model behavior and limitations
   - Focused more on interpretation than optimization
   - Logistic regression, XGBoost, etc

4. **Reflected on results**
   - What the model captures well
   - What it fails to explain
   - Why data alone may not fully represent game context


## 📈 Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

A self-directed machine learning project exploring soccer data through analysis and visualization.*
